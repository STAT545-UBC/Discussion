# Discussion

Public discussion related to STAT 545 topics will be held in [the Issues](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues) of this repository. To start a new thread, create a new Issue. Tag your peers using their handle (`@vincenzocoia`, for example) to get their attention.

__Current students__: If you want to get ahold of members of the teaching team, use these tags:

- `@STAT545-UBC/545a-2019-20-instructors` -- The instructors of STAT 545A.
- `@STAT545-UBC/545a-2019-20-TA` -- The TA's of STAT 545A.
- `@STAT545-UBC/545a-2019-20-team` -- Both TA's and instructors of STAT 545A.

Lots of the good stuff will end up in [closed Issues](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), so don't forget to look there! Or, more generally, use the "Search" feature on this repository to find things.

For discussion relevant only to the current run of STAT 545A/547M, see the [Announcements](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20/Announcements) repository.
